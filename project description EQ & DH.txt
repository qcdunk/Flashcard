Flashcard v1.0 – by Eric Qin & Donald Hughes
This program aims to provide a simple yet effective way for toddlers to learn simple words. Currently the program contains 80 words in English, covering four main categories including animals, food, people and nature. There are two modes the user can select: flash card mode and exercise mode.
In “flash card” mode, the user can go through each word in a selected category to learn the word as well as its pronunciation. Each word is presented to the user alongside a beautifully rendered picture corresponding to that word. When the picture is clicked the pronunciation of the word is played. The user can move to the next word by clicking on the “next” button. 
In the “exercise” mode, the user can select one of the five categories to test their knowledge in words in those categories. In this mode, the word alongside 4 pictures will be displayed to the user. Only one of the pictures correlates to the word. The user is then to click on the picture which they believe to be correctly linked to the word. The program gives immediately feedback regarding the user selection. Once all the cards in a selected category has been presented, the program ends by totalling the score and present in percentages. 
One feature of the program which was described in the development plan – presenting words based on the Leitner system, has not been implemented in version 1.0 of the program. Significant amount of work has been done on this topic (as evident in the unimplemented “scoreCalculator” class). However, due to time constraints, this feature has not been incorporated into this version of the program but will be introduced in a subsequent update.
